# Messaging-App
Messaging application created for a class project with a team of three components. I focused of the frontend, so I used html, css and React to develop the main aspect of the application and the implementation of all routes provided by the backend. In the backend, the stack tech is composed of NodeJS and ExpressJS in particular.
