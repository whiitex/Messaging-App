# Messaging-App
Messaging application created for a class project with a team of three components. I focused of the frontend, so I used html, css and React to develop the main aspect of the application and the implementation of all routes provided by the backend. In the backend, the stack tech is composed of NodeJS and ExpressJS in particular.

## Frontend
This part started from a .html and .css files, that allowed us to build the page in React more efficiently and faster. Than all functions from backend have been implemented to provide all messagging functinalities.

## Backend
Different routes allow authentication, data modelling and user functionalities: searching friend by nickname, add or remove friend, posting messages, open chat.
